            My name is Ariana Martinez and I am privileged to have the
            opportunity to run for the Benicia Unified School District Governing
            Board Trustee Area 5.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have the unique experience of
            being a product of Vallejo schools, a charter school, and Benicia
            High School. I have also served children and families across a
            variety of school settings in my role as a Social Worker. My entire
            career has been in public service with an emphasis on serving
            children and families.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know firsthand the importance of equity in education from my
            personal experience advocating for my sisterâ€™s educational and
            mental health needs with her IEP, as well as my professional
            experience supporting foster youth and other vulnerable populations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have established successful working relationships with various
            stakeholders including parents, school staff, service providers, and
            community members to assess and support the specialized needs of
            children and families.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have research experience in education, psychology, and social
            work. I hope to utilize my knowledge of the education system, my
            Child Welfare experience, and my skills as a Licensed Clinical
            Social Worker to ensure success for our school district.
