            {"'"}s ministry by teaching preschoolers on Sundays monthly

              She went on to further her academic pursuit by earning a Master of
              Social Work from the University of Southern California with a
              concentration in Community Organization, Planning and

              During her time as a graduate student, Ariana worked with
              different programs in a variety of health care and agency settings
              such as Kaiser Permanente, Orange County Department of Education
              (OCDE), and school districts. She applied evidenced based,

              evaluation, crisis response, and providing mental health services
              to students. During her time working at OCDE - Safe Schools &
              Support Services, she gained experience working with students,
              parents, teachers, and school administrators to support Alcohol,

            After graduating, Ariana worked as a Social Worker for Contra Costa
            County Children and Family Services and has since been promoted to a
            Staff Development Specialist, applying her child welfare experience
            to train new Social Workers and support the workforce in serving
            children, families, and communities through the pandemic. She
            learned to quickly pivot to meet the needs of her staff from various
            backgrounds and levels of experiences by adapting curriculum to a
            hybrid training model and developing new simulation curriculum to
            better prepare them for the field.

          <p>
            While working full time, Ariana has continued her professional
            development as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, keeping her
            clinical skills sharp on the most recent research and best practices
            for serving children and youth to support their social, emotional,
            and behavioral health. Outside of work, Ariana helped her local
            community by developing and facilitating the Understanding Mental
            Health class for Northgate Church. This class opened her eyes to the
            changes that are possible in people{"'"}s lives when they come
            together to share their experiences with one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Social Worker caring for foster and at-risk youth, Ariana
            worked one-on-one with children and youth from ages 0 to 21 and
            their parents as they navigated the child welfare system. She
            assessed and supported the safety, permanency, and well-being of the
            children and youth she served. She has established successful
            working relationships with various stakeholders including parents,
            school staff, service providers, and community members to assess and
            support specialized needs of children and families. Her hope is
            through collaboration and transparency, she can support our public
            schools to work towards creative solutions that ensure success for
            all students within the community.
